menuconfig MCUMGR

	depends on ZCBOR
	--help--
	  This option enables the mcumgr management library.

config MCUMGR_SMP_LEGACY_RC_BEHAVIOUR
	bool "Legacy rc (result code) response behaviour"
	depends on MCUMGR_SMP_SUPPORT_ORIGINAL_PROTOCOL
	--help--
	  This will enable legacy result code response behaviour of having rc
	  present in responses when the status is 0. With this option disabled,
	  mcumgr acts with new behaviour and will only return rc is the result
	  code is non-zero (i.e. an error occurred).

	  If a command only returns a result code, this will mean that the
	  response will be empty with the new behaviour enabled, as opposed to
	  the old behaviour where the rc field will be present in the response.
