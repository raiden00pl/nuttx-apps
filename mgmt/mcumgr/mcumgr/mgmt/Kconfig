config MCUMGR_MGMT_NOTIFICATION_HOOKS
	bool "MCUmgr notification hook support"
	help
	  With this enabled, applications and parts of code can register for MCUmgr event
	  notifications which will result in callbacks when a registered event occurs. Note that
	  this enables the base notification functionality but itself does not enable any
	  notifications, which must be enabled by selecting other Kconfig options.

	  To enable notifications in code, mgmt_callback_register() must be called with the
	  callback function and events that want to be received. Multiple handlers can be
	  registered and will all be called when registered events occur.

	  Some callbacks support notifying the calling function of a status, in which to accept
	  or decline the current operation, by returning false this will signal to the calling
	  function that the request should be denied, for informal-only notifications or
	  acceptable, true must be returned by all the registered notification handlers.

config MCUMGR_MGMT_HANDLER_USER_DATA
	bool "MCUmgr mgmt handler user data support"
	help
	  This will add an extra field to the struct mgmt_handler that will allow a user
	  to pass user_data when the defined handler is called.

config MCUMGR_MGMT_CUSTOM_PAYLOAD
	bool "MCUmgr custom payload"
	help
	  When this config is enabled, a user can use the field `custom_payload` in `mgmt_handler` to
	  skip the generation of the cbor start- and end byte in `smp_handle_single_payload` and
	  instead use a user defined payload in SMP messages.
